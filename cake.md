Q:
    For each built-in type, there is a corresponding function that checks whether a value has that type.
    You can find a list [here](https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html). Note how, although
    these functions are predicates, they lack the characterizing question mark at the end of their name.
    This is to make them stand out: the `is_` prefix indicates the predicate is meant to be used in guards,
    while "regular" predicates are not allowed there. Cakepoint for the first who tells us why.
A:
    ? notaion => any boolean returning funciton, is_ notation => typecheck
    ex.: strong_password? vs is_string
